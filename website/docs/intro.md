# Introduction

Welcome to the EasyKit documentation!

EasyKit is a versatile toolkit designed to streamline and simplify common development tasks, providing a comprehensive suite of utilities for developers of all skill levels. It is built on **.NET 8.0** and leverages modern libraries like **Serilog** for structured logging and **System.Text.Json** for fast, standards-compliant JSON serialization.

Key features include:

*   **Code Generation:** Quickly generate boilerplate code for various frameworks and languages.
*   **Project Management:** Easily manage project dependencies and configurations.
*   **Automation:** Automate repetitive tasks, such as building, testing, and deployment.
*   **Logging & Diagnostics:** Built-in logging with Serilog and diagnostics for robust troubleshooting.

EasyKit aims to accelerate the development process, reduce errors, and improve overall productivity. For more on the underlying technologies, see the [Serilog Context7 docs](https://context7.com/library/serilog/serilog) and [.NET Extensions Context7 docs](https://context7.com/library/dotnet/extensions).
