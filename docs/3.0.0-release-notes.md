# EasyKit 3.0.0 Release Notes

## Overview

EasyKit 3.0.0 is a major update that brings a complete transformation to a pure Python implementation, focusing on enhanced performance, a modern command-line experience, and a streamlined workflow for Windows users. This release is designed to provide a unified, robust toolkit for web development on Windows.

## What's New

- **Pure Python Implementation:**
  - All previous batch file dependencies have been removed. EasyKit is now fully implemented in Python for better maintainability and portability.

- **Windows-Only Support:**
  - EasyKit 3.0.0 is now designed and tested exclusively for Windows. Cross-platform support for macOS and Linux has been discontinued to focus on the best possible Windows experience.

- **Modern CLI Interface:**
  - Enhanced user experience with rich text, colors, progress bars, and interactive prompts using the `rich` library.

- **Integrated Tools:**
  - Native Python integrations for Git, Composer, NPM, and Laravel Artisan.

- **Smart Configuration:**
  - Automatic Windows-specific configuration management using `platformdirs`.

- **Automated Updates:**
  - Built-in update system with version checking and automatic downloads.

- **Enhanced Security:**
  - Improved permission handling and validation.

- **Extensive Testing:**
  - Comprehensive test suite for reliability on Windows.

## Additional Improvements

- **User-Specific Configurations:**
  - Support for JSON-based user and global configuration files in Windows directories.

- **Enhanced Logging:**
  - Logs are now stored in Windows-specific directories for better organization.

- **Removed Features:**
  - Batch file dependencies and legacy configuration methods have been removed.
  - macOS and Linux support have been discontinued.

- **Release Notes Viewer Fix:**
  - The Update Manager now correctly displays release notes files named with either `release_notes_*.md` or `*-release-notes.md` patterns, improving compatibility and user experience.

## Upgrade Notes

- Ensure you are using Windows 10 or higher and Python 3.8 or higher.
- Review the new configuration and logging locations as described in the README.
- If you previously relied on batch files, old config methods, or non-Windows platforms, migrate to the new JSON-based system and Windows-only workflow.
