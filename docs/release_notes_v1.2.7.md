# Release Notes - EasyKit v1.2.7

**Release Date:** May 9, 2025

## New Features

- **User Settings**: Added support for user-specific configurations. Users can now create a `config\user_config_eskit.bat` file to override default settings. This allows for personalized settings like color schemes, UI preferences, and default paths without modifying the core configuration file.

## Changes

- Updated version numbers across project files to 1.2.7.
- Modified `scripts\core\common_eskit.bat` to load `config\user_config_eskit.bat` if it exists.

## Bug Fixes

- None in this version.

## Installation

Download the installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/LoveDoLove/EasyKit/releases) (link will be updated upon release) and run the setup.

## Known Issues

None at this time.
