# Task Completion Report

## Task
Analyze and refactor the EasyKit project to extract reusable modules, libraries, and services into CommonUtilities for global use across C# projects.

## Summary

- **Architectural analysis** identified ConfirmationService, ConsoleService, LoggerService, ProcessService, Config, and Software as reusable.
- **Framework:** .NET 8 selected for CommonUtilities.
- **Migration:** All identified components were migrated, merged, and enhanced in CommonUtilities, organized by concern (Helpers, Utilities, Services, Models, Interfaces).
- **Unification:** Overlapping logic unified, duplication removed, and code annotated for maintainability and future NuGet packaging.
- **Exclusions:** MenuTheme was not moved.
- **Documentation:** See [`spec.md`](spec.md) for architecture, module breakdown, and UML diagrams.
- **Result:** The codebase is now modular, reusable, and ready for further extension.

## Next Steps

- Integrate CommonUtilities into other C# projects as needed.
- Prepare and publish as a NuGet package if desired.
